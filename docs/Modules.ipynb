    "\n",
    "**MIToS** tools are separated on different modules, related to different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MSA\n",
    "This module defines multiple functions and types for dealing with **MSAs** and their **annotations**. It also includes facilities for **sequence clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PDB\n",
    "This module defines types and methods to work with **protein structures** from PDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SIFTS\n",
    "This module allows access to **SIFTS residue-level mapping** of UniProt, Pfam and other databases with PDB entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information\n",
    "This module defines residue contingency tables and methods on them to estimate information measure from MSAs. It includes functions to estimate **corrected mutual information** (*ZMIp*, *ZBLMIp*) between MSA columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pfam\n",
    "This module use the previous modules to work with **Pfam MSAs**. It also has useful **parameter optimization** functions to be used with Pfam alignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utils\n",
    "MIToS has also an Utils module with common utils functions and types used in this package.\n"
